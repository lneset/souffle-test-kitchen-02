# Soufflé Test Kitchen 02 — Actionable MVP

This version adds **actionable** features:
- Criteria **weights** with sliders
- **What‑If** scenario presets (Balanced, Speed‑to‑Market, Premiumization, Cost‑Down)
- Weighted **Opportunity Scores** (bar) and **Target vs Current** (radar)
- **Prioritized table** with Design Play + Why Now + TTM
- **Auto‑generated design brief** (copy/download JSON)

## Deploy
Upload `index.html` to the repo root (replace the old one). Vercel auto‑redeploys.

## Edit Data
For now, the segment data lives in `index.html` as a JS array named `segments`. Update or extend it per client.
